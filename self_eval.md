# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- I'm most proud of how my small group helps eachother. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- In the case that we need to reuse a block of code multiple times in an application, methods save us from writing the same code over and over again. Calling a method will also help the program run faster instead of having to move a heavy over-written code multiple times.
